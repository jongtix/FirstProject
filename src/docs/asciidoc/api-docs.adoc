Sample application demonstrating how to use Spring REST Docs with JUnit 5.

`SampleJUnit5ApplicationTests` makes a call to a very simple service and produces three
documentation snippets.

One showing how to make a request using cURL:

include::{snippets}/post-controller-test/get_posts/curl-request.adoc[]
include::{snippets}/post-controller-test/save_posts/curl-request.adoc[]

And one showing the HTTP response:
